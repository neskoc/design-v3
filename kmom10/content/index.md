        <p>The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to interconnected sensors, instruments, and other devices networked together with computers' industrial applications, including manufacturing and energy management.
        </p>
        <p>
        This connectivity allows for data collection, exchange, and analysis, potentially facilitating improvements in productivity and efficiency as well as other economic benefits. The IIoT is an evolution of a distributed control system (DCS) that allows for a higher degree of automation by using cloud computing to refine and optimize the process controls.

            <div class="column-content">
            <p>
                The Arrowhead Framework is addressing IoT based automation. The approach take is that IoT's are abstracted to services. This to enable IoT interoperability in-between almost any IoT's.
                The creation of automation is based on the idea of local automation clouds.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can help you set up your own Arrowhead local cloud and connect your old or new devices to the system.
