        <h3>Automatic license plate reader with Raspberry Pi and ML</h3>
        <p>
        Automated license plate readers (ALPRs) are high-speed, computer-controlled camera systems that are typically mounted on street poles, streetlights, highway overpasses, mobile trailers, or attached to police squad cars. ALPRs automatically capture all license plate numbers that come into view, along with the location, date, and time. The data, which includes photographs of the vehicle and sometimes its driver and passengers, is then uploaded to a central server.

        <h3>Natural language processing for UN's Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
        <p>
        Machine Learning project for predicting the "compliance" of Swedish research projects in regard to UN Sustainable Development Goals.
        </p>
        <p>
        Project goals: Predict how well Swedish research projects are meeting the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (17 Global Goals) by analysing the historical research applications from SweCRIS and match them with the UN's global goals (in Swedish: Globala m√•len).

        <h3>Comparison of the current IoT technologies</h3>
        <p>
        The project aims to test and compare as many communication technologies and tools for IoT as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
        IoT devices are usually required to be extremely energy efficient in order to function for a long time powered from a small battery. In addition, they need to be able to communicate over long distances.
        Therefore, extra resources have been invested in developing energy-efficient wireless communication protocols.
